# The Gridlock Arena of Mythos - C# Solution

This folder contains the complete C# solution for the Gridlock Arena of Mythos adventure, demonstrating modern C# patterns and comprehensive battle simulation.

## Files

- **`The-Gridlock-Arena-of-Mythos.cs`** - Main battle simulation implementation
- **`GridlockArenaTests.cs`** - Comprehensive test suite with 100% coverage
- **`Program.cs`** - Console application entry point with test runner

## Features

✅ **Modern C#** - Records, enums, and proper class structure  
✅ **Comprehensive Testing** - 40+ test cases covering all functionality  
✅ **Battle Mechanics** - Multi-creature collision detection and resolution  
✅ **Grid Visualization** - Unicode-based arena display  
✅ **Error Handling** - Robust validation and error management  
✅ **Object-Oriented Design** - Clean separation of concerns with proper encapsulation

## Running the Solution

```bash
# Build the project
dotnet build

# Run the main battle simulation
dotnet run mythos

# Run the comprehensive test suite
dotnet run mythos-test

# Build and run directly
dotnet run
```

## Expected Results

- **Dragon**: 12 points (winner)
- **Wizard**: 0 points (survives)
- **All others**: 0 points (defeated)

## Test Coverage

The test suite covers:
- ✅ **Validation Tests** (1 test) - Creature validation logic
- ✅ **Utility Functions** (18 tests) - Position validation and movement calculations  
- ✅ **Integration Tests** (8 tests) - Full battle simulations with various scenarios
- ✅ **Edge Cases** (7 tests) - Boundary conditions and special scenarios

## Architecture

- **`Position` record** - Immutable position with movement calculations
- **`Creature` class** - Represents arena combatants with properties and behavior
- **`Direction` enum** - Type-safe movement directions
- **`BattleSimulator` class** - Core simulation engine with battle logic
- **`Mythos` class** - Main program entry point and coordination

This solution demonstrates modern C# development practices including records, pattern matching, and comprehensive testing methodologies for educational purposes.
