#### Sample MCP Configuration (.vscode/mcp.json)

Get a Firecrawl API key from https://www.firecrawl.dev/app/api-keys.

```json
{
  "servers": {
      "firecrawl": {
         "command": "npx",
         "args": [
            "-y", 
            "firecrawl-mcp"
         ],
         "env": {
            "FIRECRAWL_API_KEY": "${input:fireCrawlApiKey}"
         }
      },
      "filesystem": {
         "command": "npx",
         "args": [
            "-y",
            "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem", 
            "${workspaceFolder}"
         ]
      }
   },
   "inputs": [
      {
         "type": "promptString",
         "id": "fireCrawlApiKey",
         "description": "Firecrawl API Key",
         "password": true
      }
   ]
}
```

**Security Note**: Use input placeholders (`${input:variableName}`) for sensitive data like API keys rather than hardcoding them. VS Code will prompt for these values when needed.

### Using Agent Mode with MCP to Solve the Adventure

#### Step 1: Give Agent Mode a Comprehensive MCP-Integrated Task

In the Chat panel with "Agent" mode selected, provide a comprehensive prompt such as the following. While this prompt uses JavaScript and Node.js, feel free to adapt it to your preferred language or framework. This prompt assumes you've already configured the MCP servers as described above.

```
Create a complete Knowledge Cartographer system using GitHub Copilot Agent Mode with MCP tools. This should be a two-phase process:

PHASE 1: Use MCP Tools to Gather and Organize Knowledge
First, use Agent Mode with the configured Firecrawl and server-filesystem MCP servers to collect and organize knowledge data:

1. Use FireCrawl MCP Server tools to:
   - Scrape web content about topics like "quantum computing" and "artificial intelligence".
   - Extract key entities, concepts, and relationships from the scraped content
   - Analyze content quality and source credibility

2. Use File System MCP Server tools to:
   - Create a structured knowledge base directory ./akashic-archives-demo. Place the directory in the root of your workspace.
   - Organize data into topics/ and indexes/ subdirectories
   - Save entities, relationships, and sources as JSON files (entities.json, relationships.json, sources.json)
   - Create metadata and index files for each knowledge domain

PHASE 2: Create Application to Explore the Knowledge Base
Create a Node.js/JavaScript application that reads and analyzes the organized data. Only use the fs, path, and readline modules from Node.js. Do not use any external libraries or frameworks.

3. Build a Knowledge Base Reader:
   - Read the structured JSON files created by MCP tools
   - Load entities, relationships, and source information from ./akashic-archives-demo
   - Support multiple knowledge domains/topics

4. Implement Knowledge Graph Analysis:
   - Analyze relationships between entities
   - Identify connection patterns and strengths  
   - Explore concept clusters and associations

5. Create Interactive Exploration Interface:
   - Command-line interface for browsing knowledge domains
   - Commands to load topics, find entity connections, explore relationships
   - Show original source materials and metadata
   - Beautiful mystical-themed console output

6. Add comprehensive error handling and documentation

The key architecture: MCP Tools ‚Üí Structured Files ‚Üí Your Application
- MCP tools handle external operations (web scraping, file organization)
- Your application focuses on reading, analyzing, and exploring the data

Please implement this complete system with sample knowledge domains and demonstrate the exploration workflow.
```

#### Step 2: Watch Agent Mode Work with MCP Integration

Agent Mode will autonomously:
- üîó **Connect** to MCP servers and verify tool availability
- üìÅ **Phase 1**: Upon your approval, use File System MCP to create directories.
- üï∑Ô∏è **Phase 1**: Upon your approval, use FireCrawl MCP to scrape web content and extract knowledge. Write to files using File System MCP.
- üíª **Phase 2**: Create a Node.js application that reads the organized data
- üß† **Phase 2**: Build knowledge graph analysis and exploration features
- üß™ **Test** the complete system including MCP data flow and application logic
- üîß **Handle** errors and edge cases gracefully

You'll see each step in the UI, including MCP tool invocations and results.

#### Step 3: Interact and Refine with MCP Capabilities

As Agent Mode works, you can:
- **Request enhancements**: "Add support for academic paper discovery through FireCrawl scraping"
- **Explore outputs**: "Show me the knowledge graph for the topic we just researched"
- **Add features**: "Create a feature to export knowledge graphs as interactive HTML"

#### Step 4: Explore Advanced MCP Features

Once your Knowledge Cartographer system works, try asking Agent Mode to:

```
Enhance the Knowledge Cartographer with these advanced MCP integrations:
1. Implement knowledge graph merge capabilities for multiple sources
2. Create automated knowledge update workflows
3. Add support for multimedia content discovery and organization
4. Build knowledge sharing and export pipelines
5. Implement advanced graph analytics and insights
6. Create knowledge recommendation systems
7. Add integration with external knowledge bases and APIs
```

### Expected Output

When your Agent Mode implementation is complete, running the application should produce output similar to the following. AI is non-deterministic, so your results may vary slightly, but the structure should be similar.

```
