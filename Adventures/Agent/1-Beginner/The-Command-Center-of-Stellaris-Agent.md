### Background

In the distant galaxy of Stellaris, the Galactic Command Center serves as the central hub for coordinating interstellar missions across thousands of star systems. The Command Center relies on specialized AI commanders, each with unique expertise in different aspects of space exploration, battle tactics, resource management, and diplomatic negotiations. 

Recently, the Command Center's main AI system has been upgraded to support custom command protocols - specialized modes that can be activated for specific mission types. These custom modes allow commanders to access tailored knowledge bases, specialized tools, and mission-specific guidance that far surpasses standard operational procedures.

### Objective

2. VS Code will open and prompt you to install the chat mode file.
3. Choose your installation location:
   - Workspace: Install for the current project only 
   - User Profile: Install globally for all your projects
4. Confirm the installation when prompted

Can I install the custom chat mode manually? Yes!

1. Copy the text from the [Implementation Plan Generation Mode](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/github/awesome-copilot/refs/heads/main/chatmodes/implementation-plan.chatmode.md) file into your clipboard.
2. Select <kbd>Ctrl + Shift + P</kbd> (Windows/Linux) or <kbd>Cmd (‚åò) + Shift + P</kbd> (Mac).
3. Enter ‚ÄúNew Mode File‚Äù.
4. Select one of the following options: 
   - `.github/chatmodes` - Stores the custom chat mode in the current project.
   - User Data Folder ‚Äì Makes the chat mode available across all projects.
5. Give it a name of "implementation-plan-generation". 
6. Paste the contents of your clipboard into the markdown file and save it.

#### Step 3: Activate Your Specialized Commander

1. **Open the GitHub Copilot Chat panel** in VS Code (you should see the chat icon in the top bar)
2. **Select your new "Implementation Plan Creator" mode** from the dropdown at the bottom of the chat panel
3. **Choose a "Standard Model"** from the available AI models

### Mission Phase 2: Test Your New AI Commander

Now let's test your specialized Implementation Planner with a space exploration scenario!

#### Step 1: Brief Your AI Commander

In the Chat panel with your new custom mode selected, provide this mission briefing:

```
Mission Briefing: Plan the development of a "Stellar Navigation System" for our interstellar fleet.

The system should:
- Track multiple spacecraft across different star systems
- Calculate optimal hyperspace jump routes
- Monitor fuel consumption and crew status
- Provide real-time navigation updates
- Include emergency protocols for system failures

Create a comprehensive implementation plan for this mission-critical system.
```

#### Step 2: Observe Enhanced Planning Capabilities

Your specialized AI commander will now demonstrate advanced planning capabilities:

- üìã **Structured Requirements Analysis** - Breaking down complex needs systematically
- üèóÔ∏è **Detailed Implementation Steps** - Task-by-task breakdown with clear identifiers
- üîó **Dependency Mapping** - Understanding task relationships
- üß™ **Testing Strategies** - Comprehensive validation approaches
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Risk Assessment** - Potential challenges and mitigation strategies

#### Step 3: Compare with Standard Mode

To appreciate the enhancement, try the same prompt with standard Chat mode:

1. **Switch back to standard "Chat" mode**
2. **Ask the same question**
3. **Compare the responses** - notice how the custom mode provides more structured, implementation-focused guidance

### Mission Phase 3: Explore the Stellaris Command Fleet
