<a href="#">

</a>

### Background

In the mechanical town of Tempora, everything operates on clockwork and precise timing. At the heart of the town is the Grand Clock Tower, responsible for keeping time for all the town's activities. However, over the years, some smaller clocks in the town have started to drift away from the accurate time.

### Objective

Your task is to create a system that checks all the clocks in the town and synchronizes them with the Grand Clock Tower. You'll be given a list of times from various clocks around the town, and you must determine how many minutes each clock is ahead or behind the Grand Clock Tower's time.

**In this adventure, you'll learn to use GitHub Copilot Agent Mode** - an autonomous AI assistant that can understand complex tasks and break them down into multiple steps, creating entire applications from scratch!

### Prerequisites

Before starting this adventure, you'll need to perform the following steps:

1. **Install VS Code** - Download from [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
2. **Set up GitHub Copilot in VS Code** - Follow the instructions at [Set up GitHub Copilot in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/setup).

### Learning Outcomes

By completing this adventure with Agent Mode, you'll learn:

- ‚úÖ How to give high-level instructions to an AI agent
- ‚úÖ How Agent Mode breaks down complex tasks autonomously
- ‚úÖ How to iterate and refine solutions with an AI pair programmer
- ‚úÖ The power of autonomous coding assistance for complete projects
- ‚úÖ Best practices for prompting Agent Mode effectively

### Setting Up Agent Mode

1. **Open VS Code** and ensure you're signed in to GitHub.
3. **Open the Chat view** by selecting the chat icon in the top bar.
4. **Select "Agent" mode** from the dropdown at the bottom of the Chat panel.

### Specifications

Now let's define the requirements for the clock synchronization system so that you can start using Agent Mode effectively!

1. **Clock Data:**
    - The clock times are provided in a 24-hour format.
    - The Grand Clock Tower is at 15:00.
    - Clock times around town:
        - Clock 1: 14:45
        - Clock 2: 15:05
        - Clock 3: 15:00
        - Clock 4: 14:40

2. **Time Analysis and Output:**
    - You need to determine how many minutes each clock is ahead or behind the Grand Clock Tower.
    - The result should be an array of integers representing the time difference in minutes. Positive values indicate the clock is ahead, and negative values indicate it's behind.

### Using Agent Mode to Solve the Adventure

#### Step 1: Give Agent Mode a High-Level Task

In the Chat panel with "Agent" mode selected, provide a comprehensive prompt like:

```
Create a complete clock synchronization system for the town of Tempora. The system should:

1. Create a console application in JavaScript (or your preferred language)
2. Define the Grand Clock Tower time as 15:00
3. Store clock times for 4 clocks around town: 14:45, 15:05, 15:00, 14:40
4. Calculate how many minutes each clock is ahead or behind the Grand Clock Tower
5. Display the results clearly, showing positive values for clocks ahead and negative for clocks behind
6. Include proper error handling and clear documentation
7. Make the code readable and maintainable

Please create the project structure, write the code, and test it.
```

#### Step 2: Watch Agent Mode Work

Agent Mode will autonomously:
- üîç **Analyze** your workspace and determine what files to create
- üìÅ **Create** the necessary project structure
- üíª **Write** the complete application code
- üß™ **Test** the application by running it
- üîß **Fix** any issues that arise automatically

You'll see each step in the UI, showing every tool invocation.

#### Step 3: Interact and Refine

As Agent Mode works, you can:
- **Approve or modify** proposed changes
- **Ask for improvements**: "Can you add visual clock representations?"
- **Request explanations**: "Explain how the time calculation works"
- **Add features**: "Add the ability to input custom clock times"

#### Step 4: Explore Advanced Features

Once your basic system works, try asking Agent Mode to:

```
Enhance the clock system with these features:
1. Add a visual ASCII representation of each clock
2. Create unit tests for the time calculation logic
3. Add error handling for invalid time formats
4. Generate documentation explaining the system
```

### Expected Output Example

When your Agent Mode implementation is complete, running the application should produce output similar to the following. AI is non-deterministic, so your results may vary slightly, but the structure should be similar.

```
üïê Tempora Clock Synchronization System üïê
Grand Clock Tower Time: 15:00

Clock Analysis Results:
Clock 1 (14:45): -15 minutes (behind)
Clock 2 (15:05): +5 minutes (ahead)
Clock 3 (15:00): 0 minutes (synchronized)
Clock 4 (14:40): -20 minutes (behind)

Summary: 3 clocks need adjustment

üèõÔ∏è Enhanced Tempora Clock Analysis üèõÔ∏è

üóº Grand Clock Tower:
    ‚è∞ 15:00
     12
   9  |  3

```

**Verification Checklist:**
- ‚úÖ Correctly calculates time differences: [-15, +5, 0, -20]
- ‚úÖ Identifies 3 clocks needing adjustment
- ‚úÖ Includes ASCII clock visualizations
- ‚úÖ Shows clockwork/steampunk themed output
- ‚úÖ Handles time format validation
- ‚úÖ Provides clear status for each clock

#### Effective Prompting Strategies

1. **Be Comprehensive**: Give Agent Mode the full context and all requirements upfront
2. **Specify Preferences**: Mention your preferred programming language, frameworks, or patterns
3. **Set Clear Goals**: Define what "done" looks like for your project
4. **Ask for Best Practices**: Request clean, maintainable, and well-documented code

#### Leverage Agent Mode's Autonomy
