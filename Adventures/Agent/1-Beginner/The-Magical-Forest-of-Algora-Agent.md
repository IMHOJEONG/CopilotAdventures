</a>

### Background

Deep within the enchanted Forest of Algora, two mystical creatures called the Lox and the Faelis perform a sacred dance every millennium. This dance is not just for celebration but is a ritual to bring balance to the forest. Each creature has its own set of dance moves, and the combination of moves creates various magical effects in the forest.

### Objective

Your task is to create a system that simulates the sacred dance between Lox and Faelis creatures. You'll need to determine the magical effects of their combined dance moves and track the state of the forest after each sequence of the dance.

**In this adventure, you'll learn to use GitHub Copilot Agent Mode** - an autonomous AI assistant that can understand complex tasks and break them down into multiple steps, creating entire applications from scratch!

### Prerequisites

Before starting this adventure, you'll need to perform the following steps:

1. **Install VS Code** - Download from [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
2. **Set up Copilot in VS Code** - Follow the instructions at [Set up GitHub Copilot in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/setup).

### Learning Outcomes

By completing this adventure with Agent Mode, you'll learn:

- ✅ How to give high-level instructions to an AI agent
- ✅ How Agent Mode breaks down complex tasks autonomously
- ✅ How to iterate and refine solutions with an AI pair programmer
- ✅ The power of autonomous coding assistance for complete projects
- ✅ Best practices for prompting Agent Mode effectively

### Agent Mode Skills You'll Learn:
- 🎯 **Comprehensive Prompting**: Writing detailed prompts for complex, multi-step tasks
- 🔄 **AI Pair Programming**: Iterating with an autonomous AI partner that can think strategically
- 🧪 **Autonomous Testing**: Leveraging AI to create and run comprehensive test suites
- 📚 **Documentation Generation**: Getting production-ready code with complete documentation
- 🛠️ **Project Orchestration**: Managing entire project lifecycles through AI collaboration
- 🔧 **Error Resolution**: Working with AI to automatically detect and fix issues

### Setting Up Agent Mode

1. **Open VS Code** and ensure you're signed in to GitHub.
2. **Open the Chat view** by selecting the chat icon in the top bar.
3. **Select "Agent" mode** from the dropdown at the bottom of the Chat panel.

### Specifications

Now let's define the requirements for the magical dance simulation so that you can start using Agent Mode effectively!

1. **Dance Mechanics:**
   - Each creature can perform one of three dance moves: `Twirl`, `Leap`, or `Spin`
   - The dance consists of 5 sequences
   - Display the state of the forest after each sequence

2. **Magical Effects from Move Combinations:**
   - Twirl + Twirl = Fireflies light up the forest
   - Leap + Spin = Gentle rain starts falling
   - Spin + Leap = A rainbow appears in the sky
   - Other combinations create different magical effects

3. **Predefined Move Sequences:**
   - **Lox moves**: Twirl, Leap, Spin, Twirl, Leap
   - **Faelis moves**: Spin, Twirl, Leap, Leap, Spin

### Using Agent Mode to Solve the Adventure

#### Step 1: Give Agent Mode a High-Level Task

In the Chat panel with "Agent" mode selected, provide a comprehensive prompt like:

```
Create a complete magical dance simulation system for the Forest of Algora. The system should:

1. Create a console application in JavaScript (or your preferred language)
2. Define two mystical creatures: Lox and Faelis with their predefined dance moves
3. Lox dance sequence: [Twirl, Leap, Spin, Twirl, Leap]
4. Faelis dance sequence: [Spin, Twirl, Leap, Leap, Spin]
5. Implement magical effects for dance move combinations:
   - Twirl + Twirl = Fireflies light up the forest
   - Leap + Spin = Gentle rain starts falling
   - Spin + Leap = A rainbow appears in the sky
   - Create additional magical effects for other combinations
6. Simulate the 5-sequence dance and display the forest state after each sequence
7. Include proper error handling and clear documentation
8. Make the code readable and maintainable with a beautiful console interface

Please create the project structure, write the code, and test it.
```

#### Step 2: Watch Agent Mode Work

Agent Mode will autonomously:
- 🔍 **Analyze** your workspace and determine what files to create
- 📁 **Create** the necessary project structure
- 💻 **Write** the complete application code
- 🧪 **Test** the application by running it
- 🔧 **Fix** any issues that arise automatically

You'll see each step in the UI, showing every tool invocation.

#### Step 3: Interact and Refine

As Agent Mode works, you can:
- **Approve or modify** proposed changes
- **Ask for improvements**: "Can you add visual ASCII art for the forest?"
- **Request explanations**: "Explain how the magical effects system works"
- **Add features**: "Add the ability to create custom dance sequences"

#### Step 4: Explore Advanced Features

Once your basic system works, try asking Agent Mode to:

```
Enhance the magical dance system with these features:
1. Add beautiful ASCII art representations of the forest states
2. Create a system for users to define custom dance moves and effects
3. Add sound effects descriptions for each magical effect
4. Generate documentation explaining the magical dance mechanics
5. Create unit tests for the dance simulation logic
```

### Expected Output Example

When your Agent Mode implementation is complete, running the application should produce output similar to the following. AI is non-deterministic, so your results may vary slightly, but the structure should be similar.

```
